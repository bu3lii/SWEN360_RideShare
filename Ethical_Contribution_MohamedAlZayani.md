## Ethical Consideration: Convenience vs Privacy (Contributed by Mohamed AlZayani])

This section addresses the ethical trade-off between user convenience and privacy regarding GPS tracking in the University Carpooling & Ride Sharing App. While continuous location tracking could improve ride coordination and overall convenience, it introduces significant privacy concerns and potential misuse of sensitive personal data.

To protect user privacy, the system design limits GPS tracking to active ride sessions only. Location services are activated when a ride begins and automatically disabled once the ride is completed. No unnecessary long-term storage of location data is permitted.

This decision prioritizes user trust, data protection, and ethical responsibility while still supporting essential features such as navigation and ride coordination. By balancing functionality with privacy, the system avoids excessive surveillance and promotes responsible use of user data.
