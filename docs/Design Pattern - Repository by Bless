The Repository Pattern ensures organization enabling communication with the database all in one place using repositories. For our application, the repository pattern will be used inside the Model layer to handle all database access. It fits well with our MVC style, which is our chosen architecture. This pattern is helpful for features such as US3 – Posting a Ride, US9 – Booking a Ride, US20 – Ride History, and US13 – Messaging, where the stored information needs to be regularly read and updated by the system. By using this pattern, our team can avoid repeating queries and overall makes the code easier to maintain and test. For instance, if the database needs to be changed, we will only need to update the repository instead of many other files.
