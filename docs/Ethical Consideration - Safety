To maximize security of users, we decided that all communication must remain on the app to make it so no phone numbers or social media is shared. All conversations on the application are monitored by a background service with automatic keyword flagging. Users will also be able to report messages for manual moderation. Also, access to the application is only allowed after authentication using an AUBH email with 2FA, ensuring accountabilities for all actions taken by users.
