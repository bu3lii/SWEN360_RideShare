Fairness (matching algorithm) - Pushed by Jomana  

While convenience would seem to be the obvious priority in ride matching, some algorithms can accidentally enforce a bias. Our search engine algorithm prioritizes a mixture of availability, proximity, and possibly schedules. The RideShare application incorporates a proximity-based matching algorithm to promote fairness and efficiency. By integrating Google API services, the system automatically pairs riders with the closest available driver, minimizing the distance the driver must travel between multiple pickup requests. This results in shorter rider wait times, faster driver arrival, and reduced fuel consumption. The logic of this matching mechanism is represented in the component-level design of the system, where ride coordination and updates are managed. Additionally, the algorithm supports fair pricing by ensuring that all riders in a shared ride travel approximately equal distances, allowing the fare to be distributed evenly among participants.
